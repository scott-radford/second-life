# About Me 
If you're reading this, you've decided to find out more about me, Scott Radford.

I'm an engineer working in software development, robotics, and autonomated systems. I've worked with many software development teams to create, grow, and improve products for system automation using robotics, cloud services, and deployed applications.

My passion in my career has been focused on constant learning, continuous improvement, and optimizing operations for my engineering teams. 
I write effective and efficient documentation to support software engineers geting stuff done both internally and externally. Open communication, a collaborative attitude, engaging questions, and empathizing with end-users are tactics I use to help teams improve their product and work more seemlessly. My goal in a new project is to fully understand the problem, clearly define success metrics, and lead by example to create the optimal solution. 

This README provides a bit more detail to my resume, job history, and tooling experience.
The rest of this repository is a sandbox to experiement with new code, shares examples of old tooling I've worked with, and document projects that I've researched and implemented. If you have any questions, please reach out at <scottradford.dev@gmail.com>.


## Virginia Tech College of Engineering (2009-2014)
- Bachelors and Masters of Science in Mechanical Engineering
- Graduate Research Assistant for Unmanned Systems Lab
- Studied UAV Mission Control, Computer Vision, Path Planning Algorithms

I studied at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, VA for 5 years in the accelerated BS/MS program. I followed the full curriculum of Mechanical Engineering with electives focused on mechatronics, biomechanics, and computer vision. My Master's thesis focused on image stitching, road detection, and UAV and mobile robot path planning algorithms. Virginia Tech was an amazing institution focued on inventing the future through research and modern engineering excellence. 


## Mathworks (2014-2021)
### Engineering Technical Writer &rarr; Senior Engineering Technical Writer
##### MATLAB, Simulink, C++, Robot Operating System (ROS), Gazebo Simulation
##### Doc Tools: XML, HTML, Arbortext, OxygenXML, Acrolinx, DITA, Docbooks
- Performed code and deign reviews with a rapidly growing team of 30 engineers in US and India
- Authored getting started topics, reference API docs, and industry-specific application examples
- Implemented a continuous improvement tracking system and trained entire doc team on writing standards and best practices
- Authored and managed all documentation for 4 products since inception. Links to those docs are provided.
  - [Robotics System Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/help/robotics/) (2015)
  - [Navigation Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/help/nav/) (2019)
  - [ROS Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/help/ros/) (2019)
  - [UAV Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/help/uav/) (2020)

Mathworks produces enterprise-level software platforms for engineers, mathematicians, and scientists. MATLAB and Simulkink are their main platforms that provide industry-specific algorithms and iterfaces for rapid development of core functionality in various domains. Founded in 1984, Mathworks has created a great environment for learning software development, following engineering best practices, and performing automated verification and validation of systems. The Documentation group consists of >150 writers and editors who are trained on solid writing style, utilize modern publishing tools, and build docs-as-code for scalable doc systems. My work focused on learning the user-requirements for robotics applications, participating in design reviews of APIs, and creating all user-facing product documentation.

## Shopify Logistics (2021-2023)
### Senior Engineering Technical Writer
##### Javascript, TypeScript, Python, PostgresQL, GraphQL, Docker, Kubernetes, Google Cloud Platform
##### Doc Tools: Markdown, JSON, YAML, React, Docusaurus, Confluence
- Previously 6 River Systems, aquired by Shopify in 2019. Sold to Ocado group in 2023.
- Mobile robotics company operating in >100 warehouses using cloud services for software and hardware deployments
- Participated in design reviews for internal apps for network observability, change management, and robotics simulation
- Wrote API schema and other engineering docs for devops, product fullfilment services, and quality assurance groups.
- Organized Confluence spaces, authored onboarding content, and monitored doc metrics to gauge engagement

Working at 6 River Systems, and being aquired by Shopify taught me a lot about start-ups, business operations, and the challenges for robot deployment in the field. Supporting robots in a wide variety of environments, system configurations, and user requirements resulted in systems that were difficult to set up and debug. I wrote documentation for their software release process, system upgrades, configuring specific features, and testing environments through simulation. To optimize operations, I worked with teams to develop applications and APIs that simplfieid these processes and provided warnings, errors, and validation of the system through simple UIs and APIs.
